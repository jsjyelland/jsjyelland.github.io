## Starting to blog

I've never blogged before, but the author of the fast.ai course, Jeremy Howard, couldn't recomend highly enough the value of blogging, because of not only how writing down information can help you remember it much better, but also the value of putting yourself out onto the internet.

I'll be posting about interesting things I learn as I'm doing the fast.ai course, as well any thing else interesting I come across when implementing deep learning projects.

## How easy it is to get started blogging with the fast.ai blog template and github pages.

As someone who loves to delve down rabbit holes and spend way too much time doing simple things such as developing websites, I was very glad to have the fast.ai blogging template, because I almost certainly would have wanted to spend a couple of days building a nice looking blogging website from scratch, instead of learning about deep learning.

Thanks to the template, all you have to do is clone it onto your own git repository with the name of the format `<username>.github.io` and edit some markdown files. The tutorial [here](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2020-01-16-fast_template.html) runs through it very easily.

## Why markdown is so good

The template uses Jekyll to serve markdown pages as clean-looking web pages. Markdown makes it so easy to write formatted text by using some basic modifiers.

Here's an example:

```markdown
This sentence has words that are in *italics* and **bold**.

I might want to talk about a `function()`.

You can also make lists:

```markdown
- Dog
- Cat

1. Eggs
2. Bacon
```

Or even formatted code:

```python
def foo():
    print("bar")
```
