# About

ðŸ‘‹ Hey, I'm James Yelland.

I'm a sixth-year mechatronics engineering student at The University of Queensland.

I love working on robotics and AI projects, and I'm currently taking the UQ course on image processing and computer vision. I've been learning about deep learning by doing the [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) course.

I'll be documenting what I learn along the way here.
